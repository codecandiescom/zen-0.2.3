This will most likely be changed into a different format
later. Perhaps HTML pages, so you can read it within Zen itself. But
that is in the future. 

Retrieval
---------
  The official web page for Zen is http://www.nocrew.org/software/zen/. 
  There you can find information about the browser, and instructions 
  about how to get the latest version, if this should not be the one.

  
Compiling
---------
  Run `./configure' followed by `make'. It is as simple as that. You
  will need to install Zen to be able to run it. You can read general 
  information about the options to the configure script in INSTALL, 
  or by running it with argument --help.

  You will not need the oFBis framebuffer library to compile, but 
  you need it if you want to use the graphical part of Zen. 
  More information oFBis this can be found at 
  http://osis.nocrew.org/ofbis/. 

  Another graphical interface is the GTK+ interface, which, of course,
  needs GTK+ to compile. You can get this from http://www.gtk.org/. It
  is very likely that your favorite Linux distribution have GTK+ 
  libraries compiled for you already. Users of other operating systems \
  may need to compile it themselves. 

  To view images in Zen, you will also need additional libraries to
  deal with different formats. Zen supports a number of libraries for
  this: libjpeg, libpng, libungif (or giflib) and libMagick. Support
  for libMagick is disabled by default, but can be enabled by giving
  the configure script option --enable-Magick. LibMagick can handle
  many different image formats, but the other three libraries are 
  usually faster for their specific formats and they take less memory 
  to use.


Installing
----------
  Run `make install'. The default install directory is /usr/local/bin/
  and for its interface libraries it is /usr/local/lib/zen/. To
  install Zen in a different place, use the --prefix arguments to the
  configure script. 


Running
-------
  Zen supports direct files and requests using the HTTP protocol. 
  To load a file in Zen, start with:

  `zen page.html' or `zen file:///home/www/page.html'

  To start with a remote page, use the HTTP protocol:

  `zen http://www.nocrew.org/'

  If you want to connect through an HTTP proxy, you can set the
  environment variable `http_proxy' to `http://proxy:3128/', or with
  your proxy's correct URL. 

  The default user interface is the dump interface. To use a different
  interface, set the environment variable ZEN_INTERFACE before running
  Zen, or use the option -i (--interface). The currently supported 
  interfaces are:

    dump  - A plain text dump user interface.
    ofbis - A graphical framebuffer user interface. You can read more
            about this interface in ofbis-interface.txt.
    gtk   - A graphical X user interface, using the GTK+ libraries.

  Running Zen with option -h (--help) or -V (--version) will print out
  the currently available interfaces in your compilation. 

  Read the manpage for more information about command line options,
  configuration files and environment variables you can use with Zen. 


Programming
-----------
  If you would like to contribute to Zen, please read the file STYLES
  for a short description of my coding style for this project. I can,
  of course, not force you to follow it, only ask you to, but I will
  restructure patches to my liking before they go into the main 
  distribution.

  For a description about how to write your own user interface for
  Zen, please see the file interface.txt.
