The current version of oFBis only support palette based modes, or 16-
and 32-bit truecolour. 24-bit is not implemented yet, and you can
therefore not use this mode in Zen either.

oFBis uses /dev/gpmdata by default, for controlling the mouse. You get
this by starting gpm with argument "-R". It uses the busmouse
protocol, which means it can talk directly to /dev/mouse for some
architectures, for example Linux/PPC and Linux/m68k.

The keys following below can be used to control the oFBis user
interface in Zen. The mouse may also be used to select links.
