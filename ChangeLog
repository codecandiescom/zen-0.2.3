2003-09-17  Tomas Skäre  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* New year, new name, same person. Almost.

	* Changed version to 0.2.3 for release. 
	
	* Added autoconf/automake changes from
	  Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>. 
	  Zen now needs autoconf 2.57 and 
	  automake 1.7. 

	* Added some more changes in psdump from
	  Magnus Henoch. Took a while to put them
	  in. Sorry about that. 

2002-07-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added PostScript dump interface by
	  Magnus Henoch. Thanks a lot for this. 

2002-06-25  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added patch from Magnus Henoch to
	  fix HTTP redirection from servers
	  that return relative path in the
	  Location header. Thank you for that. 

2001-05-02  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Remade the drawing methods in the 
	  GTK+ interface. Instead of creating 
	  widgets for absolutely everything, 
	  we draw the texts and graphics directly
	  on the layout display. Some things
	  still need their own widgets, like
	  links and form widgets. All this
 	  speeds up the GTK+ inteface quite
	  a lot, which is good, since it was
	  enormously slow before. Still not
	  super fast, but at least better.

	* Fixed bug in layouting forms inside 
	  a table. They are now positioned 
	  correctly. 

2001-04-21  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Started to implement form support in
	  the GTK+ interface. Currently, some
	  widgets are drawn, but nothing is
	  functional as forms yet. There are
	  also some problem with checkboxes
	  and radio buttons not being drawn
	  correctly. Actually, they are not
	  being drawn at all. 

	* Fixed bug with tag parameters without
	  a given value. Set it to the name of
	  the parameter, if not given.

	* Changed version to 0.2.2. 

2001-04-13  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Save and restore scrolling positions
	  in the GTK+ user interface, when 
	  stepping back and forward and when 
	  loading a new page. It is saved in 
	  the interface_data structure of the
	  page layout part. 

2001-04-11  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* New state handling scheme, which 
	  saves a name for each state that is
	  pushed to the stack. When popping,
	  the name is given, and it is possible
	  to delete all states up to the one with
	  the given name. This simplifies the
	  state handling, as well as deals with
	  nested tags better. Pure HTML errors
	  will give a warning. These kinds of
	  warnings will later be possible to 
	  turn on and off in the settings.

2001-04-04  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented a more generic URL handling
	  and a function to split up a URL string
	  into its different components. The
	  struct is protocol_url, defined in
	  protocol.h. 

	* Added a new part and library, that I
	  would like to call common. It will
	  contain various functions that might
	  be usable in various parts of the 
	  program. Currently, it contains a
	  function to encode data into a base64
	  encoded string. 

	* Added support for authorization
	  through the URL, in the normal Netscape
	  fashion. It seems to work. 

2001-03-04  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented more real lists, ordered 
	  and unordered. However, no symbols are
	  printed in front of the list items, so
	  there is no difference between them at
	  this point. The implementation is to
	  support different indentation offsets
	  of the text. The current indentation
	  offset is stored in the alignment
	  state. 

2001-03-03  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed the tag <em> to equal <i> 
	  instead of <b>. 

2001-02-21  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Released version 0.2.1.

2001-02-20  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Updated manpage.

2001-02-07  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed configure.in script to work 
	  better with NetBSD. 

2001-01-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed the settings structure to a 
	  more generic one. This means there is
	  only one function to set a value, and
	  only one function to get a value. This
	  is to be able to more easily add more
	  settings types. 

2001-01-14  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed all occurrances of index() to
	  strchr() and all rindex() to strrchr()
	  in order to be more POSIX compliant. 
	  Rightfully pointed out by Michael 
	  Pollard. 

2001-01-07  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed version to 0.2.1.

	* Define DEBUG in config.h, if configured
	  with --enable-debug.

	* Read interface specific configuration
	  files, right after we initialize the
	  user interface.

	* Fixed bug that made the last line in
	  a configuration file not to be read,
	  if there was no ending new line.

	* Moved default setting of interface
	  specific values to the interface init
	  function. 

	* Provide helper functions for the user
	  interfaces, to set the default values 
	  of their settings.

	* Fixed overflow bug in oFBis interface.
	  Spotted by Michael Pollard. 

2000-12-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Released version 0.2.0.

2000-12-13  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Test compiled on an alpha, to ensure
	  64-bit compatibility. The plain text
	  and the GTK+ interfaces work. Some
	  minor changes were made to remove
	  warnings when compiling. 

2000-12-12  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added support for GIF decoding using
	  libungif or giflib. Libungif is preferred,
	  but if it does not exist, we look for
	  giflib. Their functionality should be
	  the same, just that giflib can write
	  images too, and therefore suffers from
	  patent problems in some parts of the
	  world.

	* The support for libMagick is now disabled
	  by default, since we have direct support
	  for JPEG, PNG and GIF. It can still be
	  used, if compiled with --enable-Magick.
	  Not using libMagick makes the memory
	  foot print drop by about 500KB.

	* Fixed a bug dealing with URLs and 
	  saving the base parts. 

	* Changed version to 0.2.0.

2000-12-09  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bug for reading user configuration
	  file. It now actually finds the home
	  directory for the user.

	* Separated the progress logo from the
	  GTK+ interface, to its own shared 
	  library. It can then be loaded by the
	  interface. A new configuration option,
	  gtk_use_progress_logo, is added to
	  let the user decide if it should be 
	  used or not.

	* Generate a header file, paths.h, 
	  currently containing the path to where
	  the shared libraries are installed. 

	* Added user interface functions to 
	  let the interfaces read configuration
	  settings. 

2000-11-20  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Released version 0.1.2.

2000-11-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bug in the URL parsing, that 
	  made URLs with colons in them to not
	  work properly. 

	* Made http_proxy a configuration 
	  setting, and not only an environment
	  variable. 

	* Fixed mistake, so environment should
	  override the extra configuration files
	  given on the command line. 

2000-11-14  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Make it possible to specify your own
	  user agent identifier string, that will
	  be sent to the HTTP servers when 
	  requesting pages. It is encouraged not
	  to use this option.

	* Use mkstemp() to create a temporary
	  file when decoding images with 
	  libMagick.

	* Some fixes to get rid of warnings
	  when compiling on other systems. 

2000-11-13  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed version to 0.1.2.

	* Implemented configuration files, global 
	  in /etc/zen/ and user in ~/.zen/. 

	* Remade the settings struct into a linked
	  list, and provide functions to set and 
	  get settings from it. It is all squeezed
	  into the new src/settings.c. 
	  From configuration files, environment 
	  variables and command line options, it
	  all ends up in the settings struct. 

	* New command line options -d 
	  (--dump_config) to dump a configuration
	  file, and -c (--config) to read an extra
	  configuration file. 

	* New environment variable, 
	  ZEN_DEFAULT_PAGE, to specify the default
	  page. 

	* Updated documentation to match program. 

2000-10-29  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nopanic.nocrew.net>

	* Released version 0.1.1.

2000-10-26  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Add paragraphs before and after a 
	  pre-tag. 

	* Changed working version to 0.1.1. 

	* Symbolic links, gzen and fbzen, are
	  created when installing Zen. If they 
	  are used to run the program, the GTK+
	  and the oFBis interface, respectively, 
	  are used as default, if nothing else 
	  is specified by the -i option. 

	* Updated the manpage with the latest
	  new features. 

2000-10-25  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented a plain text parser, which 
	  basically puts the whole file between
	  a <pre></pre> container tag. It is used
	  for MIME version text/plain.

	* Only use setjmp in pngs.c, if the used
	  libpng is compiled with setjmp support.
	
2000-10-21  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Released version 0.1.0.
	
	* Fixed bug in PNG decoding for palette
	  based displays. Mallocing too small
	  space for colourmap.

2000-10-14  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed a bug in dealing with interlaced
	  PNG images. 

	* Added percentage counters in the status
	  field, when decoding JPEG and PNG images. 

2000-10-13  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Increased the main version to 0.1.0, 
	  and the version of the GTK+ interface
	  to 0.0.2. 
	
	* Added direct support for PNG images, 
	  using the libpng library. This further
	  reduces the need for libMagick.

	* Added support for libMagick 5.2.x.

2000-10-10  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed the colour allocation in the GTK+ 
	  interface. This fixes the colour problems
	  that existed on 8-bit displays.
	
2000-08-07  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Store endian information in the user
	  interface display struct, to convert
	  truecolour images correctly on all
	  displays. 

2000-06-17  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Packaged for release 0.0.3.

	* Fixed memory leak when converting
	  character entities. 

	* Added progress logo when creating a
	  distribution package of Zen. 

2000-06-06  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Use gdk_threads_enter() and 
	  gdk_threads_leave(), to ensure that there
	  is no conflicts between threads in the 
	  GTK+ interface. This cures the problems
	  with Xlib sequence errors that used to
	  appear now and then. 

	* Moved all GTK+ initialization into 
	  gtkui_open(), from the init() function
	  in the GTK+ interface. This is done,
	  because we want all GTK+ in the interface
	  thread, and not in the main thread. 

2000-06-04  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added tags <i> and <address> for italic 
	  text style. 

	* Added <em> tag for making bold text. 

	* Support different text styles in the GTK+
	  interface. Font face is not yet supported, 
	  but monospaced font, for example in the
	  <pre> tag, will really get a monospaced
	  font. 

2000-06-03  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added image support for the GTK+ interface.

	* Added an animated progress logo in the
	  GTK+ interface, placed next to the buttons
	  at the top. It animates when loading a page. 
	  For those who do not know chinese, the sign
	  stands for Zen Buddhism. 

	* Use page identifiers when requesting pages
	  from interactive user interfaces. The page
	  identifiers are then used when polling for
	  a page, or when getting the status text
	  for the page. 
	  Note that this is not yet fully implemented,
	  which means multiple windows, and separate
	  page loading is still not possible. I should
	  have thought this through better from the
	  start, really, but it is a little late for
	  that now. 

2000-05-23  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added table support in the GTK+ interface. 
	  Since all layouting are done outside of the
	  interface, we just draw what we are told to
	  draw here, no big deal. 

	* Fixed a few cosmetic bugs in the table
	  layouting, when cellspacing was set to zero.

	* Texts that should be underlined, are now
	  also underlined in the GTK+ interface.

2000-05-14  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Text links are now working in the GTK+ user
	  interface. The code for it is so far local and
	  specific for the text parts, but this might 
	  change so there is a general link handling
	  part, that handles both text and graphical
	  links. Selection of links can only be done
	  using the mouse at this point. 

	* Background colours are drawn in the GTK+
	  user interface. 

	* Cleaned up, and removed old functions left
	  over when copying code from the oFBis interface
	  which is not necessary for the GTK+ interface.

	* The back and forward buttons in the GTK+
	  interface are implemented. 

2000-05-12  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented text and horizontal line drawing
	  in the GTK+ user interface. Only one font face
	  and font size is supported as of yet, but this
	  will surely change later on. The GTK+ interface
	  is actually getting useful.

2000-05-10  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* After a long time of virtually nothing, I have
	  now returned, and have started implementing a
	  GTK+ user interface for Zen. Things look good, 
	  it is a pretty easy API to use. At this moment,
	  the interface is working up to the point that
	  it requests a page, but nothing is rendered
	  yet. I hope that this will not be too difficult
	  a task, and that much of it can be provided
	  already by the GTK+ library. 

2000-03-13  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Even better check for libMagick. Now using the
	  program Magick-config to figure out where the
	  libraries and include files can be found.

	* Support libMagick 5.x API.

	* The CVS version does no longer contain premade
	  Makefile.in, configure and other similar files.
	  They are instead created by the script autogen.sh
	  which is supposed to be used to configure Zen.
	  Distributions will still have the necessary
	  files.

2000-03-09  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added support for relative width in table cells. 
	  These are done with <td width="2*"> syntax. The
	  relative widths have the lowest priority, and is
	  only used when the width cannot be figured out
	  any other way.

	* Better checking for libMagick in the configure.

2000-02-24  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Use uintX_t instead of u_intX_t all over the
	  program. This is because uintX_t is in the ISO-C
	  9X standard, and u_intX_t is not.

	* Fixed with type checking, and minor changes to
	  compile in Solaris. The plain text dump interface
	  works. Next porting session will be for MiNT on
	  Atari.

2000-02-07  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed the user interface operation get_text_width
	  into a more generic set_size, which sets the width
	  and height for some part types. This now takes care
	  of the previous text width, and will take care of
	  the width and height of some form widgets, which 
	  only the user interfaces can know the sizes of.

	* Started implementing forms. The frameworks of forms
	  and submit buttons are created, but none of it
	  actually do anything yet. On the other hand, it
	  does not interfere with the rest of the program 
	  either. 

2000-02-05  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Separated JPEG image handling to work directly
	  against libjpeg, to improve speed and quality for
	  JPEG images. 

	* The image handlers are no longer needed to compile
	  Zen. If only libjpeg is found, only JPEG images 
	  will work. If only libMagick is found, all images
	  are supported, but being slightly slower on JPEG
	  images. If none of them are found, no images are
	  loaded. 

	* Support connection through an HTTP proxy. Use by
	  settings the environment variable `http_proxy'.

2000-01-26  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed version for Zen and the oFBis user 
	  interface to 0.0.2, to make it ready for a 
	  second public release.

2000-01-25  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Make it possible to set a mark in the linked list
	  of states, which is used for tables, so that the 
	  state changes inside a table does not affect the 
	  original state, after the table.

2000-01-22  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added support for different widths of fonts. This
	  is done by asking the user interface what the width 
	  of a specific text with specific text styles will
	  be.

	* Added support for aligning in a div-tag.

2000-01-20  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented support for using table cell width,
	  if it is specified in the HTML file.

2000-01-16  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bugs which sometimes aligned tables twice.

2000-01-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Scroll using bitblt in the oFBis user interface,
	  and only redraw what needs to be redrawn.

	* Fixed bug which made whole pages go away if there
	  was a <!DOCTYPE...> tag, which was interpreted as
	  a comment tag.

2000-01-09  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bugs in table handling. Again.

	* Better background colour handling in tables. Only
	  the actual table cells are filled with colour. 
	  This is how Netscape does it.

2000-01-08  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented cellpadding and cellspacing in tables.

	* Implemented background colour in tables and table
	  cells.

	* Recognise some basic colours by name.

	* More character entities supported. Some special
	  which were not part of the indices 160-255 of
	  ISO-8859-1.

	* Fixed various bugs in the table handling, and
	  layouting.

2000-01-06  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented support for tables. They are not yet
	  complete, and might not always work. In fact, pages
	  that previously worked might now crash. This will 
	  be fixed shortly. 

	* Tables are supported by the oFBis user interface.

	* Various bugfixes has been made.

	* Rowspan in table cells supported a little later.

	* Implemented character entity conversion. Those are
	  &nbsp; and all those.

2000-01-04  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bug in aligning parts which were child parts
	  to links.

2000-01-02  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added possibility to compile with Electric Fence, 
	  which is another malloc debugging library. This is
	  enabled with --enable-efence to the configure script
	  and may not be used at the same time as ccmalloc.

	* Added basic support for tables. It still looks the 
	  same way as before, with paragraphs and whitespace,
	  but the layout part structure is there, ready to be
	  fully supportive.

1999-12-29  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added possibility to compile with libccmalloc, using
	  configure option --enable-ccmalloc. This is used to 
	  help prevent memory leaks and/or overwrites.
	  All memory leaks seems to have been removed from Zen
	  now. LibMagick seems to have some leaks, but that is
	  nothing I can prevent.

	* Shifted commands 'a' and 'z' in the oFBis user interface
	  scrolls only one pixel in each direction.

1999-12-28  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed bug when drawing, or not drawing some parts which 
	  might, or not might be outside the display.

	* Treat all unknown return codes as 404 in HTTP request.

1999-12-23  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Make clipping work on images. It was annoying that 
	  large images were not shown at all.

1999-12-16  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added key command 'g' in the oFBis user interface, to
	  be able to enter a new URL to go to, without quitting
	  the program. 

1999-12-15  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added progress status, which is printed in the control
	  field in the oFBis user interface. 

	* Take care of host relocation through HTTP codes 301
	  and 302. 

	* Simplify protocol_http_open() by extracting the actual
	  request sending into its own function.

1999-12-12  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Changed version to 0.0.1, ready for a release.

	* Check for libofbis in the configure script, and do not
	  compile the oFBis user interface, if it cannot be found.

	* Support the script-tag in such a way that the script
	  is completely ignored. 

1999-12-05  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented threading for interfaces which support
	  interaction. The main thread just waits for the
	  interface to finish right now. The interface thread
	  make requests to get a new page using helper functions
	  provided by the generic user interface. This then
	  starts a new thread when loading the new page, and the
	  interface polls now and then to see if the new page is
	  finished.

	* New key command 'r' in the oFBis user interface to 
	  redraw the current page.

Fri Nov 26 23:36:56 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Put new pages into the linked list, right after the
	  current page, instead of at the end, as it was before.

Thu Nov 25 21:02:31 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Strip double slashes, slash dots and slash dot dots
	  from URLs before using them.

	* Support base-tag, to be able to view the images
	  on the httptunnel webpage.

Thu Nov 18 20:27:50 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed truecolour handling so that it actually works.

	* Added a control field at the top of the oFBis user
	  interface display, a grey area where currently the
	  title and the URL is written.

	* Link URLs are being printed in the control field
	  when they are highlighted.

Tue Nov 16 18:31:45 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Accept headers from faulty HTTP servers, which does
	  not conform to the HTTP standard by only sending LF
	  after lines in the header, where the standard says
	  a CRLF should be sent.

Sun Nov 14 01:54:25 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Handle active links, by changing colour of the links
	  if the mouse pointer comes on them. It is also
	  possible to move the currently choosen link with
	  TAB and Shift+TAB, and select the link by pressing
	  Return.

	* Changed the method for calculating the default 256
	  colour palette into something I believe would give
	  a better selection of colours, even though I have
	  yet to prove this to the common people.

	* Protocol opening function and related ones now 
	  accept a referer URL, although it is not yet sent to
	  the server. It is used to find the correct URL on
	  pages not being the last opened page.

	* Scrolling of parts in the oFBis user interface is
	  handled more correctly.

Sat Nov 13 01:34:19 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* The oFBis user interface is now able to scroll the
	  page, and also to step between previously loaded
	  pages.

Thu Nov 11 23:01:32 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Some bugfixes with the mouse pointer, and image
	  parsing which did not work.

Wed Nov 10 23:15:17 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* The oFBis interface is now interactive, with a simple
	  mouse pointer, which enables the user to click on
	  links to follow them. Very primitive so far, but it
	  works. Pressing 'q' exists the oFBis interface.

	* The above means handling of links are implemented.

Sun Nov  7 22:03:04 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Moved all rendering handling into the user interfaces.

	* Let the user interfaces call a helping function,
	  retrieve_page(), to get an object from a specified
	  URL.

	* The above two paragraphs are preparations for making
	  interactive interfaces possible, although this is not
	  yet implemented.

Thu Nov  4 00:30:16 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed image reading to handle transparent images, 
	  although they are not drawn as transparent yet.

	* Changed the type LAYOUT_PART_TITLE into 
	  LAYOUT_PART_PAGE_INFORMATION, to contain various
	  information about the page, including the title. This
	  now is always the first part of the linked list. It 
	  also contains the background, text and link colours
	  as specified in the body-tag, or default values.

	* Simple list support, by setting row breaks when 
	  bumping into li-tags. 

Sun Oct 31 10:34:40 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed relative URLs to work. New base URLs are stored
	  when an HTML page is being processed.

	* Colours are correctly handled and the oFBis interface
	  has the function ofbis_get_closest_colour() to find
	  the best suiting colour index or value.

	* Fixed bug with the center-tag. Moved its handling into
	  the paragraph tag handler.

	* When loading files, check the extension of the file to
	  determine what type of file it is. Loading via HTTP,
	  we get the type in the response from the server.

Sat Oct 30 22:37:01 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented images using the libmagick library. Since
	  relative URLs are not yet supported, there are not
	  many images that are actually shown.

	* Above paragraph should be larger, since it is indeed 
	  a big step forward for Zen.

Fri Oct 29 00:16:47 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added support for center-tag. 

	* New files in src/image/ to handle image loading and
	  converting. This is not yet implemented, but the main
	  structure is there. 

	* Added type of interface in the user interface struct. 
	  Added display struct in there too, and moved the width
	  and height settings inside that.

Wed Oct 27 23:25:41 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented two new command line options:
	  -i (--interface) for setting the interface to use,
	  -s (--source) to dump the source from the stream.
	  A new file, src/settings.h, added for this reason.

	* Fix a bug in the dump user interface to get the
	  correct new lines at the correct places. 
	
Wed Oct 27 00:35:05 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented the pre-tag, and it actually worked on 
	  the first try. Incredible. 

	* Fixed so that it is possible to an URL like
	  http://www.nocrew.org/software, and not having to
	  add the extra slash at the end. Ignorant people do
	  this, even if it is wrong. I am considering not
	  to support it.

Mon Oct 25 22:42:51 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Fixed a few bugs regarding the font size which 
	  occurred in the handling of td and th-tags. 

	* Tried to implement vertical alignment, but that did
	  not look all that well, so it is commented out for 
	  the time being.

Sat Oct 23 20:59:43 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* New files src/protocol/http.c and src/protocol/http.h
	  for handling the HTTP protocol. A simple getting of
	  pages are possible. 

	* Alignment of horizontal lines are corrected. 

	* Align text and horizontal lines in the dump user
	  interface by putting whitespace characters in front
	  of the part.

Mon Oct 18 01:53:18 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Added enough files in src/protocol/ to support file
	  protocol.

	* Use the protocol functions to open a stream. Now it
	  does not need to read som stdin anymore, it can read
	  files as well. 

Sun Oct 17 19:27:03 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* New files src/parser/states.c and src/parser/states.h
	  are used to keep track of text style and alignment
	  states. Styles are put into the part from 
	  parse_string_store_current() and alignments are put
	  into the parts in layout_add_part().

	* Changed the layout part list into a double linked one. 
	  This is needed by the layouter to align parts.

	* Added support for new tags: table, font, big, small.
	  Table is not really supported, but only puts in a new
	  paragraph. Font tag only supports changing the size.
	  This, together with big and small tags, gives you a
	  clue that different font sizes in general are supported.
	  
	* Paragraph and header tags now handle horizontal alignment.
	  Different header tags gives different font sizes and 
	  styles. 

	* The oFBis interface handles different font sizes, 8, 
	  14 and 16 pixels high. 

	* Horizontal alignment is supported. 

Fri Oct 15 00:33:51 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented support for bold and strong tags. This
	  is drawn by the oFBis interface.

Mon Oct 11 21:31:17 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Implemented a first, very basic interface for the
	  framebuffer, using the oFBis library. Things are
	  pretty hard coded so far, in where to look for the
	  header files, and things like that. A check for
	  oFBis will soon be placed within the configure.in.
	  The oFBis interface is in src/ui/ofbis/.

	* Added basic support for underline and anchor tag. 
	  The anchor tag does not yet provide a link, but only
	  makes the text underlined, and in a different colour.

	* Image size is read from the tag, if available.
	  Otherwise, they are set to 16 times 16 pixels by the
	  layouter.

	* Fixed bugs in the layouter when handling the text, and
	  finding out how and when to cut them.

	* Added layout part type LAYOUT_PART_DELETED, to be able
	  to easily mark a part as deleted, but not really do it.
	  This is much easier and quicker than to actually delete
	  it, and does not take up much extra memory.

	* The user can now choose what user interface to use with 
	  the help of the environment variable ZEN_INTERFACE. The
	  default interface is "dump".

	* Added an interface specific pointer in the zen_ui struct.

	* Changed parse_string_store_current() to return a pointer
	  to the layout part it stored the text into. This to let
	  the parser set specific attributes of the part.

Thu Oct  7 21:42:52 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Made the dump user interface into a shared library, 
	  which is then loaded by the generic user interface
	  initialization routine. Modularization is the way
	  to go.

Wed Oct  6 23:59:41 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* New file: src/layouter/layout.c that does the layouting
	  of the parts collected by the parser. 

	* New file: src/ui/dump/dump_title.c that prints the
	  title for the dump user interface. 

	* src/parser/helpers.c: parse_string_trim() trims the
	  internal string from whitespace characters, and is used
	  before putting the string into a layout part.

	* src/ui/control.c: Set default values in the user
	  interface struct before calling the user interface init
	  routine.

	* src/ui/zen_ui.h: Separate support values into its own
	  struct to make things easier to read.

	* src/ui/dump/*.c: Adjust to conform to the values the 
	  layouter puts into the layout parts.

	* Handle and print out the title of the page. It always
	  comes first.
	
Sat Oct  2 12:54:13 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* User interfaces are now used. Currently only a small
	  version of a plain text dump user interface is supported,
	  but more will come as time goes.

	* src/ui/dump/ added, containing files to make up the
	  dump user interface. 

	* src/ui/control.c and src/ui/render.c takes care of the
	  main user interface, which then finds and calls the 
	  user interface the user has choosen to be used. 
	  src/ui/ui.h and src/ui/zen_ui.h are used for structures
	  and prototypes for all this.

	* src/parser/tags.c: Moved parse_tag_store_current_string 
	  to src/parser/helpers.c and renamed it to 
	  parse_string_store_current, to conform with the parse
	  string function naming.

	* src/main.c: Call the user interface routines for 
	  initialization and rendering of the parsed page. 

	* src/parser/html.c: No longer call the layout printing
	  routines, but let the user interface do that part.

	* src/layouter/show.c: Removed, since the dump user
	  interface does this work nowadays. 

Wed Sep 29 23:58:01 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* src/layouter/layout.h: added structs for layout parts
	  and prototypes for functions using it.
	
	* src/parser/tags.c: Added support for hr-tag, br-tag and 
	  img-tag, plus the previously empty support for paragraph 
	  and header tags. Moved header tag interpretation into its
	  own tag function. Function parse_tag_store_current_string()
	  will put the current string into the layout part list.

	* src/parser/html.c: removed all printing code, and let the
	  tag functions create the layout part list, which is then
	  printed.
	
	* Created files src/layouter/build.c for building layout 
	  parts linked lists and src/layouter/show.c for a quickly 
	  implemented plain text dump function.

Thu Jul 22 22:44:23 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Directory src/layout renamed to src/layouter.

	* New files: 
	  src/layouter/layout.h with structs and prototypes for
	  handling layout parts.
	  src/parser/tags.h contains the tag structs previously
	  contained in src/parser/html.h.
	  src/parser/tags.c contains functions which ar bound to
	  the supported tags. Paragraph tags are added, but yet
	  only with an empty function.

	* src/parser/html.h: moved tag structs to src/parser/tags.h.

	* src/parser/helpers.h, src/parser/helpers.c: added string 
	  handling functions.

	* src/parser/html.c: call tag functions binding when a tag
	  has been found in the stream.

	* New file STYLES added, containing information about how the
	  source code and text files included in the package are to 
	  be written.

Mon Jun 28 23:12:41 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* src/parser/html.h, src/parser/helpers.h: changed function
 	  prototypes to be extern.
	  
	* src/parser/helpers.c: no longer convert everything into lower
 	  case, but only the tag and parameter names. Handle quoted
 	  parameter values correctly. Removed parse_remove_quotes(), which
 	  is no longer needed.

	* src/parser/helpers.h: removed prototype for
 	  parse_remove_quotes().
	
Wed Jun  9 20:52:27 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* src/parser/html.h: added prototype for parse_html().

	* src/parser/html.c: implemented parse_html().

	* src/parser/helpers.c: parse_read_word(): convert read word into
 	  lower case.

Wed May 19 00:05:57 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Imported Zen into the NoCrew CVS server.

	* Removed src/parser/parse.c because I decided to let the MIME
 	  code determine the type of the document, and not the content of
 	  the data.

	* Added src/parser/html.h with structs for tags and
 	  src/parser/helpers.c with helping functions to aid the parsing.

Tue Mar 16 01:02:42 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* src/parser/parse.c and src/parser/html.c are created to build
 	  libparser.a. They do not do anything.

Sun Mar 14 14:46:36 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Documentation of functions and other entities will be done in
 	  javadoc style.

	* src/main.c has arised and Zen is now a complete Hello world
 	  program.

Sun Mar 14 02:22:29 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Basic directory structure and configure files are in place.

	* README: created and written into.

Sat Mar 13 23:01:42 1999  Tomas Berndtsson  <tomas@nocrew.org>

	* Zen has been created, the journey has begun.
