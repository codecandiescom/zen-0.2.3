\This/is_Zen,_the\web browser of Your choice.



Background

  I am a big fan of Lynx, and use it much. I used to like Netscape,
  but the more it has been developed, the larger it has become, and
  the more bugs it has. Frustrations sneaks up on you while you sit
  there and try to make the flashing animations and annoying frames
  to work as you like. It will not happen. 

  I still felt that it is sometimes nice to have images in the page
  but I do not want to have to run X, especially not on the Falcon,
  a 16MHz Atari. Having already made a framebuffer library and with
  it an image viewer, the step was not far for us to make a browser
  which also used the framebuffer library, oFBis. 

  When I started thinking about how to make a browser in a way that
  would combine the simple interface of Lynx, but yet being able to
  show images, I decided to separate the user interface as far as I
  could from the rest of the code, which makes it easy to implement
  several different interfaces on the same browser, and letting You
  choose the interface or Your choice. 


Future

  What You make of it.
