Zen - The web browser of Your choice!
---

Zen is a long term project, which will only be written to when the
author or authors are in the mood for it. As the creator, I have a few
requests regarding the coding style and style of other texts involved
in the Zen project.


Coding style
------------

Indentation is to be two characters, for this is what I am used to and
find suitable for myself.

All functions and struct will have a comment above them, written in
the style of Javadoc. Have a peek at the functions and structs that
are already written to see how to write these. I will begin another
project within reasonable time, that will be a program to parse these
comments and create HTML pages from them, unless I can find a program
that does this in a good way.


Other styles
------------

All texts included in the Zen package will be written without
abbreviations. 


Thank you for respecting my wishes,
